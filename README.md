# edu-errors-typescript-code

This repository provides code used for exercises and demonstrations
included in the TypeScript version of the [Crafting an Error Handling Strategy with TypeScript](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/errstrat/) training course.

It's important to remember that the example code used in this course was designed to support learning a specific aspect of Temporal, not to serve as a ready-to-use template for implementing a production system.

For the exercises, make sure to run `temporal server start-dev --ui-port 8080 --db-filename clusterdata.db` in one terminal to start the Temporal server. For more details on this command, please refer to the `Setting up a Local Development Environment` chapter in the course. Note: If you're using the Codespaces environment to run this exercise, you can skip this step.
